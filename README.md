# CTGage
## Introduction
This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of the CTGage model described in our paper:
**"Artificial Intelligence-derived Cardiotocography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Predicting Future Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes".**

CTGage is a low-cost, non-invasive digital biomarker for predicting the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes by directly predicting fetal biological age from CTG time series using deep learning models.
