# CTGage
## Introduction
This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of the CTGage model described in our paper:
**"Artificial Intelligence-derived Cardiotocography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Predicting Future Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes".**

CTGage is a 1D-CNN that predicts fetal biological age directly from raw CTG time-series, enabling a low-cost, non-invasive digital biomarker (CTGage-gap) for adverse-pregnancy-risk stratification.
